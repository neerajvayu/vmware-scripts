By using vSphere PowerCLI cmdlets, you can automate creating different inventory objects on vSphere.
Prerequisites
Verify that you are connected to a vCenter Server system.
Procedure
1
Get the inventory root folder and create a new folder named Folder in it.
$folder = Get-Folder -NoRecursion | New-Folder -Name Folder
2
Create a new datacenter named DC in the Folder folder.
New-Datacenter -Location $folder -Name DC
3
Create a folder named Folder1 under DC.
Get-Datacenter DC | New-Folder -Name Folder1
$folder1 = Get-Folder -Name Folder1
4
Create a new cluster Cluster1 in the Folder1 folder.
New-Cluster -Location $folder1 -Name Cluster1 -DrsEnabled -DrsAutomationLevel FullyAutomated
Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) is a feature that provides automatic allocation of cluster resources.
5
Add a host in the cluster by using the Add-VMHost command, and provide credentials when prompted.
$vmhost1 = Add-VMHost -Name 10.23.112.345 -Location (Get-Cluster Cluster1)
6
Create a resource pool in the root resource pool of the cluster.
$myClusterRootRP = Get-Cluster Cluster1 | Get-ResourcePool -Name Resources
New-ResourcePool -Location $myClusterRootRP -Name MyRP1 -CpuExpandableReservation $true -CpuReservationMhz 500 -CpuSharesLevel high -MemExpandableReservation $true -MemReservationGB 1 -MemSharesLevel high
7
Create a virtual machine asynchronously.
$vmCreationTask = New-VM -Name VM2 -VMHost $vmhost1 -ResourcePool MyRP01 -DiskGB 100 -MemoryGB 2 -RunAsync
The RunAsync parameter indicates that the command runs asynchronously. This means that in contrast to a synchronous operation, you do not have to wait for the process to complete before supplying the next command at the command line.
