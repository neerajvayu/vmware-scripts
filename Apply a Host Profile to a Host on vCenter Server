To simplify operational management of large-scale environments, you can apply standard configurations called host profiles to hosts on vCenter Server. If you want to set up a host to use the same host profile as a reference host, you can attach the host to a profile.
Prerequisites
Verify that you are connected to a host that runs vCenter Server 4.0 or later.
Procedure
 
1
Get the Host2 host.
$vmhost2 = Get-VMHost Host2
2
Attach the Host2 host to the HostProfile1 host profile.
Set-VMHost -VMHost $vmhost2 -Profile HostProfile1
3
Verify that the Host2 host is compliant with the HostProfile1 profile.
Test-VMHostProfileCompliance -VMHost $vmhost2
The output of this command contains the incompliant settings of the host, if any.
4
Apply the profile to the Host2 host.
$neededVariables = Apply-VMHostProfile -Entity $vmhost2 -Profile $hp1 -Confirm:$false
The $neededVariables variable contains the names of all required variables and their default or current values, as returned by the server. Otherwise, the $neededVariables variable contains the name of the host on which the profile has been applied.
